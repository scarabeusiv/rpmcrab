"""Vendor upstream distro configs (openSUSE + SLFO) into rpmcrab.

Copies ``configs/openSUSE/*.toml`` from the pinned upstream rpmlint commits
into ``crates/rpmcrab-core/data/distro/<flavor>/``, prunes ``Filters`` /
``BlockedFilters`` entries that reference findings rpmcrab no longer emits,
drops whitelist stanzas for packages gone from Tumbleweed/SLE 16 and stale
pie-executables paths, and stamps provenance.

The checked-in files are the build's source of truth; this script runs by hand
and in CI (drift check + monthly refresh), never at build time.

Upstream remains the owner of these configs until rpmlint is fully superseded:
the monthly ``distro-config-sync`` CI job opens a refresh PR when upstream
moves, and the ``distro-config-drift`` CI job fails when the vendored copies
diverge from what this script produces at the pinned SHAs.

Usage:
    scripts/generate-distro-configs.py [--check] [--ref-dir DIR]
        [--pin opensuse=SHA:DATE] [--pin slfo=SHA:DATE]

    --check      regenerate into a temp dir and diff against the repo;
                 exit 1 with a unified diff on any divergence.
    --ref-dir    use a local rpmlint checkout instead of fetching from
                 GitHub (both pinned SHAs must exist in it).
    --pin        override a pinned SHA for the refresh workflow; DATE is the
                 commit date (YYYY-MM-DD) used for the provenance stamp.

# Stale pie-executables paths: each entry is (owning package, kind, reason),
# carrying per-entry evidence like PRUNE_PACKAGES does. kind "removed" means
# the owning package is gone from openSUSE:Factory (OBS source API 404);
# kind "moved" means the package still ships but relocated the binary. The
# package is checked live at generation time: a reintroduced "removed"
# package - or a vanished "moved" package, whose relocation evidence is then
# stale - keeps the path and logs loudly, so the drift check fails for a
# fresh audit instead of the path staying silently pruned. "moved" entries are
# additionally checked at filelist level at generation time: an old path that
# still ships in the current Factory filelist is kept with a loud log, and
# the Leap 16.0 filelists are checked the same way as the SLES proxy (Leap
# 16 is SLES-based and public; SLE sources sit behind Customer Center auth).
# Verified 2026-10-07 against the openSUSE:Factory filelists (97 paths shipped
# by no TW package), and 2026-10-08 against the Leap 16.0 binary repodata
# for the slfo flavor (same upstream removals apply). Pruning runs per-flavor:
# each entry's owning package is checked live against the flavor's own
# codebase at generation time (OBS source API for openSUSE:Factory, published
# binary repodata for Leap 16.0 — see package_present()).
